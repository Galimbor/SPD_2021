# Parallel and Distributed Systems Subject - Full project 

## Description
This project was developed with the objective of illustrate the impact of parallell approaches in software development versus sequencial approaches. For such, it was used the C programming language to build a simple program that solves the magic square problem. It was implemented using 5 different approaches, which will be described below.

## Approaches

+ **First Approach** : Strict sequencial implementation
+ **Second Approach** : Parallelized approach using PThreads, more specifically 12.
+ **Third Approach** : Parallelized approach using OpenMP, a simple API to facilitate the usage of PThreads in this case.
+ **Fourth Approach** : Distrubuted approach using MPICH, an implementation of the pattern MPI which is used in data communication for distributed systems.
+ **Fifth Approach** : Hybrid approach, using OpenMP and MPICH, so both paralellized and distributed.

## How to start working on the project and get it running

+ Open a directory where you would like to store the project.
+ Open a terminal window on that directory.
+ Run `git clone https://github.com/Galimbor/SPD_2021.git`.
+ Open IntelliJ IDEA.
+ Install git and github* plugins and restart IntelliJ.
+ Open -> IA_LAB_4    You're going to work here.
+ Click on the blue arrow the upload the remote project into yours.
+ Go to VCS -> Git -> Branches... -> + New Branch -> Enter the name of your branch and create.
+ Start working
+ After your work is done click on the green arrow -> Write your commit message under "Commit Message", make sure your commiting to the branch you just created (you can confirm this by looking above "Commit Message")
+ Look at the Commit button below, click on the arrow at the right end of the button and click "Commit and Push..."
